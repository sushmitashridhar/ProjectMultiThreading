Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads are spawned by a process to perform tasks concurrently, improving efficiency and performance. Each thread runs in the same memory space, allowing for sharing of resources, though this can also lead to potential issues like race conditions.

Multithreading is commonly used in applications that need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as:

Concurrent data processing
Handling multiple requests (web servers)
Real-time applications (e.g., games, simulators)
